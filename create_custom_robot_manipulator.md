# Creating Custom Robot in Fusion360

## Introduction

In robotics, we need a way to describe our robot (its shape, size, joints, and links) so that simulators and control software can use it.  
This description format is called **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format).  



In this tutorial, you will:
<!-- TOC -->
* [Model a simple mobile robot manipulator in **Fusion360**](#model-a-simple-mobile-robot-manipulator-in-fusion360)

* [Convert the design into **URDF format**](#convert-the-design-into-urdf-format)

* [Prepare it for use in simulators such as **Isaac Sim** or **Gazebo**](#prepare-it-for-use-in-simulators-such-as-isaac-sim-or-gazebo)
 
<!-- TOC -->


By the end, you‚Äôll have your own robot model ready for simulation üöÄ  



## Before You Start

- Make sure you have **Autodesk Fusion360** installed.    
- Have a basic understanding of sketches in Fusion360.

## Rules for Creating Robots in Fusion360

When modeling a robot in Fusion360, there are a few important rules to follow so that the robot can be successfully exported to URDF and work correctly in simulation:

1. **Separate each moving part into its own body**  
   - Example: The chassis, each wheel, and the lidar should all be **separate bodies**.  

2. **Rename bodies clearly**  
   - This makes it easier to manage later.  
   - Example: `base_link`, `front_wheel_left`, `front_wheel_right`, etc.  

3. **Convert bodies into components**  
   - URDF requires components (links) rather than raw bodies.  

4. **Add joints between moving parts**  
   - For wheels, we will add **revolute joints** so that they can rotate.  

5. **Define materials for each component**  
   - Materials provide physical properties (like mass and friction) used by the simulator.  





=============================

# Model a simple mobile robot manipulator in **Fusion360**

In Fusion360, create a new sketch, and in Fusion360,

1. ### Create the chassis of the robot:
    - Start by creating a new sketch on the XY plane.

    - Draw a rectangle with dimensions 200 mm (length) √ó 100 mm (width).
    ![chassis sketch](/isaac_sim/data/first_sketch.png)

    - Finish the sketch.

    - Use the Extrude tool (E Key) to give the rectangle a height of 40 mm.

    - You now have the chassis box of the robot, measuring 200 √ó 100 √ó 40 mm
    ![Robot chassis sketch](/isaac_sim/data/base_link.png)

2. ### Create Axles for wheel joints:

    - On the side face of the chassis, create a new sketch.

    - Draw a circle with a diameter of 10 mm.

    - Use the Extrude tool to pull the circle outward by 5 mm. This creates a cylindrical axle for the wheel joint.

    - Repeat the process on each corner of the chassis (you should have 4 axles in total).
    ![Wheel joint sketch](/isaac_sim/data/base_link_with_joints.png)
    ![Wheel joint sketch](/isaac_sim/data/base_link_up.png)

3. ### Create the Wheels:
    - Select the front face of one axle and create a new sketch on it.
    - Draw a circle with a diameter of 80 mm. This will define the wheel‚Äôs outer edge.
    - Use the Extrude tool to pull the circle outward by 20 mm.
    ![Wheel sketch](/isaac_sim/data/add_wheel.png)
    - In the Extrude settings, set the operation to New Body (not Join). This ensures the wheel is treated as a separate part, which is required for URDF export. Finish the sketch
    - Repeat for remaining axles
    ![Wheels and chassis](/isaac_sim/data/bodies.png)
    - After finishing you should have 5 separate bodies in your design


4. ### Add Lidar: To make easier to track robot heading 
    - Select the top face of the chassis and create a new sketch.
    - Draw a circle with a radius of 25 mm (diameter = 50 mm).
    - Use the Extrude tool (E) to pull the circle upward by 20 mm.
    ![Lidar and wheel stripes](/isaac_sim/data/add_all_wheels.png)

5. ### Add Wheel Stripes: To track wheel rotation in simulation
    - Select the outer face of one wheel and create a new sketch.
    - Draw a thin box (for example: 6 mm wide √ó 10 mm tall √ó 3mm high) from the center of the wheel.
    - Repeat this process for each wheel.
    ![Lidar and wheel stripes](/isaac_sim/data/add_bars_to_wheels.png)

6. ### Rename the Bodies
    - In the Browser panel (left-hand side of Fusion360), expand the Bodies folder.

    - Right-click on each body and rename it to something meaningful.
    - In my case:
        ```
        Body1 ‚Üí base_link (the main chassis)

        Body2 ‚Üí front_wheel_right

        Body3 ‚Üí front_wheel_left

        Body4 ‚Üí rear_wheel_right

        Body5 ‚Üí rear_wheel_left
        ```
7. ### Create Components from Bodies 
    - Right-click on Bodies folder
    - Select ‚ÄúCreate Components from Bodies‚Äù.
    ![components ](/isaac_sim/data/renamed_components.png)



# Add revolute joints to robot

1. ### Let's add revolute joints to each wheel, so that it was able to ratate
    - Press J on your keyboard to open the Joint tool. (English Keyboard).   Alternatively, you can access it from the Assemble ‚Üí Joint menu.

    - Define the Joint for a Wheel
        ```
        Select Component 1 ‚Üí Click on the center (origin) of the wheel.

        Select Component 2 ‚Üí Click on the origin of the corresponding axle (on the chassis).
        ```

    - In the Joint Type options, select Revolute.
    ![add revolute joints ](/isaac_sim/data/how_add_rev_joint.gif)

    -  Repeat for All Wheels


2. ### Assign Materials to the Robot
    - In the **Browser panel**, right-click on any component (e.g., `base_link`) and select **Physical Material**.  
    - In the **Physical Material window**, drag and drop materials from the library onto the robot‚Äôs parts:  
        - `base_link` ‚Üí Metal (e.g., Aluminum or Steel)  
        - Wheels ‚Üí Rubber (or ABS Plastic for rims)  
    - Repeat the process for all components until each has a defined material.

```powershell
cd <path to fusion2urdf>

cp -r ./URDF_Exporter "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/Scripts/"

# Prepare it for use in simulators such as **Isaac Sim** or **Gazebo**

One Last Step left:

### Finalize the URDF

1. Navigate to the directory where you saved the robot description.  
2. Inside the **urdf/** folder, locate the exported file.  
3. Change the file extension from **.xacro** to **.urdf**.
